# Logistic-Regression-Project-Predicting-DMV-Outcomes
In this project, we create the Logistic Regression algorithm from scratch to predict whether someone will pass or fail to get their DMV license. From creating the Sigmoid function to creating the cost function and gradient descent, this project explains all the steps behind the scenes that make Logistic Regression a powerful classifier.
